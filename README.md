# Control-of-a-two-wheeled-robot

My bachelor thesis.

The program models a two-wheeled robot and controls it in space, divided into a state graph. Using the Dijkstra algorithm, BFS and the Q-learning machine learning algorithm, the optimal path on the graph is searched.

The program contains graphical interface which shows moving of a robot. The interface allows a user to enter the initial and final states of the robot.
